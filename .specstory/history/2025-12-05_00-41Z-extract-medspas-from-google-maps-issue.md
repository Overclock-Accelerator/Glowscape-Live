The user is encountering an error with the Google Maps tool. The error shows:

```
AttributeError: 'ApifyTools' object has no attribute 'get_tools'
```

This is happening in `google_maps_tool.py` at line 37 where it's trying to call `apify_tools.get_tools()[0]`.

Let me read the google_maps_tool.py file to see what's going on.</details></think>

I'll help you fix this issue. Let me first examine the Google Maps tool to understand the problem.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The issue is clear. The code is trying to call `apify_tools.get_tools()[0]` on line 37, but `ApifyTools` doesn't have a `get_tools()` method. 

Looking at how ApifyTools is used in Agno, I need to check the proper API. Let me search for documentation or check how it's supposed to be used.

The ApifyTools class likely exposes the tools differently. Let me check the Agno documentation for ApifyTools to understand the correct usage pattern.</details></think>

The toolkit implements a \\\"Think → Search → Analyze\\\" cycle that allows an Agent to: Think through the problem and plan search queries Search the knowledge base for relevant information Analyze the results to determine if they are sufficient or if additional searches are needed This approach significantly improves an Agent's ability to provide accurate information by giving it tools to find, evaluate, and synthesize knowledge. The toolkit includes the following tools: think : A scratchpad for planning, brainstorming keywords, and refining approaches.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Perfect! Now I understand. Looking at the basic usage example from the Apify documentation, I can see that `ApifyTools` is meant to be passed directly to the Agent's `tools` parameter. The Agent will then automatically handle calling the Apify actors.

The current implementation is wrong because it's trying to manually call `apify_tools.get_tools()` and then execute the function directly. Instead, `ApifyTools` should be used as a toolkit that provides tools to the agent, not called manually.

The correct approach for this use case would be to either:
1. Use ApifyTools directly in the agent (not in a custom tool), or
2. Use the Apify API directly within the custom tool using the `apify-client` library.

Since the user already has a custom tool defined, the best approach is to use the `apify-client` library directly to run the actor. Let me check if it's in the requirements.</details></think>
