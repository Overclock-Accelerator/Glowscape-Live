# Building an Agno agent for Medspa scraping (2025-12-05 00:13Z)

_**User (2025-12-05 00:13Z)**_

We are looking to build an Agno based agent that is capable of scraping a large volume of Medspa locations in a city. We want the agent to use the APIfy toolkit for google maps / places scraping.



I will ask you a series of questions and instruct you in steps through the implementation.



COnfirm your understanding before continuing.



# Apify



This guide demonstrates how to integrate and use [Apify](https://apify.com/actors) Actors within the Agno framework to enhance your AI agents with web scraping, crawling, data extraction, and web automation capabilities.

## What is Apify?

[Apify](https://apify.com/) is a platform that provides:

* Data collection services for AI Agents, specializing in extracting data from social media, search engines, online maps, e-commerce sites, travel portals, or general websites

* A marketplace of ready-to-use Actors (specialized tools) for various data tasks

* Infrastructure to run and monetize our own AI Agents

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for an [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/sign-up)

2. Obtain your Apify API token (can be obtained from [Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api))

3. Install the required packages:

```bash  theme={null}

pip install agno apify-client

```

## Basic Usage

The Agno framework makes it easy to integrate Apify Actors into your agents. Here's a simple example:

```python  theme={null}

from agno.agent import Agent

from agno.tools.apify import ApifyTools

# Create an agent with ApifyTools

agent = Agent(

    tools=[

        ApifyTools(

            actors=["apify/rag-web-browser"],  # Specify which Apify Actors to use, use multiple ones if needed

            apify_api_token="your_apify_api_key"  # Or set the APIFY_API_TOKEN environment variable 

        )

    ],

        markdown=True

)

# Use the agent to get website content

agent.print_response("What information can you find on https://docs.agno.com/introduction ?", markdown=True)

```

## Available Apify Tools

You can easily integrate any Apify Actor as a tool. Here are some examples:

### 1. RAG Web Browser

The [RAG Web Browser](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser) Actor is specifically designed for AI and LLM applications. It searches the web for a query or processes a URL, then cleans and formats the content for your agent. This tool is enabled by default.

```python  theme={null}

from agno.agent import Agent

from agno.tools.apify import ApifyTools

agent = Agent(

    tools=[

        ApifyTools(actors=["apify/rag-web-browser"])

    ],

        markdown=True

)

# Search for information and process the results

agent.print_response("What are the latest developments in large language models?", markdown=True)

```

### 2. Website Content Crawler

This tool uses Apify's [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor to extract text content from websites, making it perfect for RAG applications.

```python  theme={null}

from agno.agent import Agent

from agno.tools.apify import ApifyTools

agent = Agent(

    tools=[

        ApifyTools(actors=["apify/website-content-crawler"])

    ],

    markdown=True

)

# Ask the agent to process web content

agent.print_response("Summarize the content from https://docs.agno.com/introduction", markdown=True)

```

### 3. Google Places Crawler

The [Google Places Crawler](https://apify.com/compass/crawler-google-places) extracts data about businesses from Google Maps and Google Places.

```python  theme={null}

from agno.agent import Agent

from agno.tools.apify import ApifyTools

agent = Agent(

    tools=[

        ApifyTools(actors=["compass/crawler-google-places"])

    ]

)

# Find business information in a specific location

agent.print_response("What are the top-rated restaurants in San Francisco?", markdown=True)

agent.print_response("Find coffee shops in Prague", markdown=True)

```

## Example Scenarios

### RAG Web Browser + Google Places Crawler

This example combines web search with local business data to provide comprehensive information about a topic:

```python  theme={null}

from agno.agent import Agent

from agno.tools.apify import ApifyTools

agent = Agent(

    tools=[

        ApifyTools(actors=[

            "apify/rag-web-browser",

            "compass/crawler-google-places"

        ])

    ]

)

# Get general information and local businesses

agent.print_response(

    """

    I'm traveling to Tokyo next month.

    1. Research the best time to visit and major attractions

    2. Find one good rated sushi restaurants near Shinjuku

    Compile a comprehensive travel guide with this information.

    """,

    markdown=True

)

```

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Ask)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to build an Agno-based agent that can scrape MedSpa locations using the Apify toolkit, specifically for Google Maps/Places scraping. They've provided documentation about how Apify integrates with Agno.

Let me confirm my understanding of what they want to build:

1. An Agno agent
2. Using Apify tools (specifically the Google Places Crawler - `compass/crawler-google-places`)
3. To scrape MedSpa locations in a city
4. Handle large volumes of data

The user wants me to confirm understanding before proceeding with step-by-step implementation.

Let me summarize what I understand and confirm before they provide further instructions.</details></think>

---

I understand the goal. Here's my summary:

**Objective:** Build an Agno-based AI agent that scrapes MedSpa business locations from Google Maps/Places using the Apify platform.

**Key Components:**
1. **Agno Framework** - The AI agent framework that will orchestrate the scraping
2. **Apify Tools Integration** - Specifically using `compass/crawler-google-places` Actor to extract business data from Google Maps
3. **Target Data** - MedSpa locations in a given city (potentially large volume)

**Technical Stack:**
- `agno` - Agent framework
- `apify-client` - Apify API client
- Apify API token (from Apify console)
- The `ApifyTools` class from `agno.tools.apify`

**Basic Pattern:**
```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.apify import ApifyTools

agent = Agent(
    tools=[
        ApifyTools(
            actors=["compass/crawler-google-places"],
            apify_api_token="your_token"  # or via APIFY_API_TOKEN env var
        )
    ]
)
```

**Considerations for Large Volume Scraping:**
- Rate limiting / API costs on Apify
- Pagination handling for results
- Data storage strategy for collected MedSpa data
- Possible need for geographic subdivision (scraping by neighborhood/area) if city-wide queries return too many results

Ready for your step-by-step instructions.

_**User (2025-12-05 00:13Z)**_

Let's begin by creating an initial agent that can run in the terminal and will simply respond with an explanation of its capabilities. It is the GlowScape agent and it can extract information about medspas.



For now DO NOT BUILD any of the tool calling infrastructure.



We simply want a working agent that responds to our requests and is aware of its system prompt.



use agno.

The user wants me to create a basic Agno agent called "GlowScape" that:
1. Runs in the terminal
2. Responds with an explanation of its capabilities
3. Is aware of its system prompt (about being a MedSpa data extraction agent)
4. Does NOT have tool calling infrastructure yet - just a simple conversational agent

Let me first check the Agno documentation to make sure I understand the correct way to create a basic agent.</details></think>

This Python script demonstrates the basic usage of an Agent with the AWS Claude model. It shows how to initialize the agent and either capture the response in a variable or print it directly to the terminal. Dependencies include the 'agno' and 'anthropic' libraries.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent, RunOutput  # noqa
from agno.models.aws import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0"), markdown=True
)

# Get the response in a variable
# run: RunOutput = agent.run("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
# print(run.content)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

### Generated System Message for Agno Agent Output

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/agents/context.mdx

This text snippet shows the system message generated by an Agno agent configured with a specific `description` and `instructions`. It illustrates how these parameters are compiled into a structured prompt, including `<instructions>` and `<additional_information>` tags, which is then sent to the underlying language model.

```text
You are a famous short story writer asked to write for a magazine                                                                          
<instructions>                                                                                                                             
- Always write 2 sentence stories.                                                                                                         
</instructions>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                            
<additional_information>

### Initialize Agno Agent with Description and Instructions (Python)

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/agents/context.mdx

This Python code demonstrates initializing an Agno agent with specific `description` and `instructions` to define its persona and behavior. It configures the agent to use `OpenAIChat` and includes settings for markdown output and debug logging, then triggers a response generation based on a user prompt.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    description="You are a famous short story writer asked to write for a magazine",
    instructions=["Always write 2 sentence stories."],
    markdown=True,
    debug_mode=True  # Set to True to view the detailed logs and see the compiled system message
)
agent.print_response("Tell me a horror story.", stream=True)
```

--------------------------------

### Set Agent Instructions with Agno Python

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/examples/concepts/agent/context_management/instructions.mdx

This Python snippet initializes an Agno agent with specific instructions to guide its response behavior and storytelling style. It uses the `Agent` class from the `agno.agent` module to define a custom storytelling prompt and then prints a response based on that instruction.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(instructions="Share a 2 sentence story about")
agent.print_response("Love in the year 12000.")
```

--------------------------------

### Integrate Slack Tool Instructions into Agno Agent System Message

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/agents/context.mdx

This Python snippet demonstrates how to embed specific instructions for using a tool within an `agno.agent`'s system message. It configures `SlackTools` with detailed usage guidelines for `send_message` and `send_message_thread`, ensuring these instructions are injected into the agent's prompt to guide its interaction with the Slack platform.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.slack import SlackTools

slack_tools = SlackTools(
    instructions=["Use `send_message` to send a message to the user.  If the user specifies a thread, use `send_message_thread` to send a message to the thread."],
    add_instructions=True,
)
agent = Agent(
    tools=[slack_tools],
)
```

--------------------------------

### Set Agent System Message Directly in Python

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/agents/context.mdx

This Python code demonstrates how to manually set an Agno agent's system message using the `system_message` parameter. This overrides any other system message configurations, allowing for complete control over the agent's initial instructions. It also shows a basic interaction with the agent.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
agent.print_response("What is the capital of France?")

agent = Agent(system_message="Share a 2 sentence story about")
agent.print_response("Love in the year 12000.")
```

--------------------------------

### Run Agent Script (Bash)

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/examples/getting-started/02-agent-with-tools.mdx

Executes the Python script named 'agent_with_tools.py'. This command starts the AI agent, allowing it to process input prompts and generate responses based on its configured instructions and tools.

```bash
python agent_with_tools.py
```

--------------------------------

### Configure Agno Agent with Comprehensive System Message Parameters

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/agents/context.mdx

This Python snippet demonstrates how to initialize an `agno.agent.Agent` with a wide range of parameters that contribute to building a detailed system message. It sets the agent's role, instructions, additional context, expected output format, and flags for including datetime, location, name, session summary, memories, and session state in the system message.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="Helpful Assistant",
    role="Assistant",
    description="You are a helpful assistant",
    instructions=["Help the user with their question"],
    additional_context="""
    Here is an example of how to answer the user's question: 
        Request: What is the capital of France?
        Response: The capital of France is Paris.
    """,
    expected_output="You should format your response with `Response: <response>`",
    markdown=True,
    add_datetime_to_context=True,
    add_location_to_context=True,
    add_name_to_context=True,
    add_session_summary_to_context=True,
    add_memories_to_context=True,
    add_session_state_to_context=True,

### Create AI Agent for Image Generation with DALL-E

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/examples/getting-started/14-image-generation.mdx

This Python code demonstrates how to create an AI agent using the 'agno' library for image generation with DALL-E. It configures the agent with a specific model, tools (DalleTools), a detailed description, instructions, and a database connection. The example shows how to use the agent to generate an image from a text prompt and retrieve the resulting image URL.

```python
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.run.agent import RunOutput
from agno.tools.dalle import DalleTools

# Create an Creative AI Artist Agent
image_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[DalleTools()],
    description=dedent("""
        You are an experienced AI artist with expertise in various artistic styles,
        from photorealism to abstract art. You have a deep understanding of composition,
        color theory, and visual storytelling.
    """),
    instructions=dedent("""
        As an AI artist, follow these guidelines:
        1. Analyze the user's request carefully to understand the desired style and mood
        2. Before generating, enhance the prompt with artistic details like lighting, perspective, and atmosphere
        3. Use the `create_image` tool with detailed, well-crafted prompts
        4. Provide a brief explanation of the artistic choices made
        5. If the request is unclear, ask for clarification about style preferences

        Always aim to create visually striking and meaningful images that capture the user's vision!
    """),
    markdown=True,
    db=SqliteDb(session_table="test_agent", db_file="tmp/test.db"),
)

# Example usage
image_agent.print_response(
    "Create a magical library with floating books and glowing crystals",
)

# Retrieve and display generated images
run_response = image_agent.get_last_run_output()
if run_response and isinstance(run_response, RunOutput):
    for image_response in run_response.images:
        image_url = image_response.url
        print("image_url: ", image_url)
else:
    print("No images found or images is not a list")

# More example prompts to try:
"""

Now I have enough information to create the basic Agno agent. Let me create:

1. A `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies
2. A main Python script (`main.py` or `agent.py`) that creates the GlowScape agent with:
   - A system prompt/description about being a MedSpa data extraction agent
   - Instructions about its capabilities
   - A simple terminal interface to interact with it

Let me create the project structure.</details></think>

Now I have enough context. Let me create the basic GlowScape agent.

**Plan:**
1. Create `requirements.txt` with dependencies
2. Create `.env.example` for API key configuration
3. Create `glowscape_agent.py` - the main agent with system prompt describing MedSpa extraction capabilities

The error is expected - the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is not set. The agent code is correct. You'll need to create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key.

Let me verify the files are created properly:

The agent is complete. Here's what was created:

---

**Files Created:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `glowscape_agent.py` | Main agent with system prompt, description, and interactive terminal loop |
| `requirements.txt` | Dependencies: `agno`, `openai`, `python-dotenv` |
| `.gitignore` | Standard ignores for Python/env files |

**To Run:**

1. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

2. Run the agent:
```bash
python glowscape_agent.py
```

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Name:** GlowScape
- **Model:** `gpt-4o-mini`
- **System Prompt:** Describes MedSpa extraction capabilities, Google Maps/Apify data source, and the types of business data it can extract
- **Instructions:** 7 behavioral guidelines for how the agent should respond

The agent will introduce itself on startup, then enter an interactive loop where you can ask questions. Type `quit`, `exit`, or `q` to end the session.

Now go ahead and create infrastructure for tool calling. 

Specifically if the user requests that we extract the list of medspas in a city make a tool call to the "MedSpa Extraction Tool."

For now, the medspa extraction tool should simply generate a gibberish set of 10 medpas. We will add the functionality over time. 

Inform the user that the tool call has been made in your response.

3. For now, the tool should return mock/gibberish data (10 fake MedSpas)
4. The agent should inform the user that the tool call has been made

I need to:
1. Create a custom tool class for MedSpa extraction
2. Register it with the agent
3. The tool should return fake data for now

### Define and Use a Custom Agno Agent Tool (Python)

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/tools/overview.mdx

This snippet demonstrates how to create a custom tool using the `@tool` decorator in Agno, integrate it with an `Agent` instance, and observe its execution. The `get_weather` function simulates fetching weather data for a given city, and the agent uses it when it deems it relevant. The `stop_after_tool_call=True` argument ensures the agent stops processing after the tool's result.

```python
import random

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools import tool

# This is our tool, marked by the @tool decorator
@tool(stop_after_tool_call=True)
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather for the given city."""

    # In a real implementation, this would call a weather API
    weather_conditions = ["sunny", "cloudy", "rainy", "snowy", "windy"]
    random_weather = random.choice(weather_conditions)

    return f"The weather in {city} is {random_weather}."

# To equipt our Agent with our tool, we simply pass it with the tools parameter
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-nano"),
    tools=[get_weather],
    markdown=True,
)

# Our Agent will now be able to use our tool, when it deems it relevant
agent.print_response("What is the weather in San Francisco?", stream=True)
```

--------------------------------

### Configure KnowledgeTools Options in Python

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/tools/reasoning_tools/knowledge-tools.mdx

This snippet illustrates how to customize the `KnowledgeTools` toolkit during initialization. It shows how to enable or disable individual tools like `think`, `search`, and `analyze`, and how to add default instructions or provide custom few-shot examples to guide the Agent's behavior effectively.

```python
from agno.tools.knowledge import KnowledgeTools

knowledge_tools = KnowledgeTools(
    knowledge=my_knowledge_base,
    think=True,                # Enable the think tool
    search=True,               # Enable the search tool
    analyze=True,              # Enable the analyze tool
    add_instructions=True,     # Add default instructions
    add_few_shot=True,         # Add few-shot examples
    few_shot_examples=None,    # Optional custom few-shot examples
)
```

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/tools/attaching-tools.mdx

Illustrates how to define multiple custom tools (`get_stock_price`, `get_stock_availability`) and assign them to a Team using the `set_tools` method. This replaces any previously assigned tools, providing a new set of functionalities.

```python
import random

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.team.team import Team
from agno.tools import tool
from agno.tools.calculator import CalculatorTools


agent1 = Agent(
    name="Stock Searcher",
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
)

agent2 = Agent(
    name="Company Info Searcher",
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
)

team = Team(
    name="Stock Research Team",
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
    members=[agent1, agent2],
    tools=[CalculatorTools()],
    markdown=True,
    show_members_responses=True,
)


@tool
def get_stock_price(stock_symbol: str) -> str:
    """Get the current stock price of a stock."""
    return f"The current stock price of {stock_symbol} is {random.randint(100, 1000)}."

@tool
def get_stock_availability(stock_symbol: str) -> str:
    """Get the current availability of a stock."""
    return f"The current stock available of {stock_symbol} is {random.randint(100, 1000)}."


team.set_tools([get_stock_price, get_stock_availability])

team.print_response("What is the current stock price of NVDA?", stream=True)
team.print_response("How much stock NVDA stock is available?", stream=True)
```

### Integrate a Pre-built Agno Toolkit with an Agent (Python)

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/tools/overview.mdx

This example shows how to equip an Agno Agent with a pre-built `Toolkit`, specifically `GoogleSearchTools`. By passing an instance of the toolkit to the agent's `tools` parameter, the agent gains access to the toolkit's functionalities, such as web searching, without needing to define individual tools.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Importing our GoogleSearchTools ToolKit, containing multiple web search tools
from agno.tools.googlesearch import GoogleSearchTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[
        GoogleSearchTools(),
    ],
)

agent.print_response("What's the latest about OpenAIs GPT-5?", markdown=True)
```

### Define Custom Tool for Agno Agent to Fetch Hacker News Stories

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/concepts/agents/tools.mdx

This snippet illustrates how to create a custom Python function, `get_top_hackernews_stories`, and register it as a tool with an Agno Agent. The tool fetches and formats top stories from Hacker News using the `httpx` library.

```python
import json
import httpx

from agno.agent import Agent

def get_top_hackernews_stories(num_stories: int = 10) -> str:
    """Use this function to get top stories from Hacker News.

    Args:
        num_stories (int): Number of stories to return. Defaults to 10.
    """

    # Fetch top story IDs
    response = httpx.get('https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json')
    story_ids = response.json()

    # Fetch story details
    stories = []
    for story_id in story_ids[:num_stories]:
        story_response = httpx.get(f'https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{story_id}.json')
        story = story_response.json()
        if "text" in story:
            story.pop("text", None)
        stories.append(story)
    return json.dumps(stories)

agent = Agent(tools=[get_top_hackernews_stories], markdown=True)
agent.print_response("Summarize the top 5 stories on hackernews?", stream=True)

### Create Team with Custom Knowledge Base and Web Search Fallback (Python)

Source: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/examples/concepts/teams/tools/team_with_custom_tools.mdx

Defines a custom tool 'answer_from_known_questions' that queries a static FAQ. It then creates a 'Q & A team' with this custom tool and a 'Web Agent' powered by DuckDuckGo for web searches. The team is tested with a question, and its session information and tools are displayed.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team.team import Team
from agno.tools import tool
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools


@tool()
def answer_from_known_questions(question: str) -> str:
    """Answer a question from a list of known questions

    Args:
        question: The question to answer

    Returns:

    faq = {
        "What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
        "What is the capital of Germany?": "Berlin",

        "What is the capital of Spain?": "Madrid",
        "What is the capital of Portugal?": "Lisbon",
        "What is the capital of Greece?": "Athens",
        "What is the capital of Turkey?": "Ankara",
    }

    # Check if question is in FAQ
    if question in faq:
        return f"From my knowledge base: {faq[question]}"
    else:
        return "I don't have that information in my knowledge base. Try asking the web search agent."


# Create web search agent for fallback
web_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Agent",
    role="Search the web for information",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    markdown=True,
)

# Create team with custom tool and agent members
team = Team(name="Q & A team", members=[web_agent], tools=[answer_from_known_questions])

# Test the team
team.print_response("What is the capital of France?", stream=True)

# Check if team has session state and display information
print("\n📊 Team Session Info:")
session = team.get_session()
print(f"   Session ID: {session.session_id}")
print(f"   Session State: {session.session_data['session_state']}")

# Show team capabilities

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I understand how to create custom tools in Agno. I can use the `@tool` decorator to create a function that will be called by the agent. Let me update the `glowscape_agent.py` file to:

1. Create a `medspa_extraction_tool` function that generates mock data
2. Register it with the agent

I'll create a tool that:
- Takes a city as input
- Returns mock MedSpa data (10 fake medspas)
- The agent should inform the user that the tool call has been made

Let me first read the current state of the file to see the user's change to gpt-5-mini.</details></think>

Now I'll update the file to add the MedSpa extraction tool. I'll:

1. Import the `tool` decorator from `agno.tools`
2. Import `random` and `json` for generating mock data
3. Create a `medspa_extraction_tool` function that generates 10 fake medspas
4. Register it with the agent
5. Update the instructions to tell the agent to use the tool and inform users when it's called</details></think>

The code is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was added.</details></think>

---

Done. Here's what was added:

**Tool Infrastructure:**

1. **`medspa_extraction_tool`** (lines 90-114) - A function decorated with `@tool` that:
   - Takes a `city` parameter
   - Generates 10 mock MedSpa entries with randomized data
   - Returns JSON with: id, name, address, phone, website, rating, review_count, services, hours

2. **Mock data generators** (lines 48-87) - Helper data and function to create realistic-looking fake MedSpa entries

3. **Updated instructions** (lines 36-37) - Agent is now instructed to:
   - Use the tool immediately when users ask to extract/find/list MedSpas
   - Always inform users that the tool call has been made

4. **Tool registration** (line 123) - The tool is passed to the agent via `tools=[medspa_extraction_tool]`

**Data fields returned per MedSpa:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `name` - Business name (e.g., "Glow MedSpa")
- `address` - Street address in the specified city
- `phone` - Formatted phone number
- `website` - Generated URL
- `rating` - 3.5-5.0 rating
- `review_count` - Number of reviews
- `services` - Random selection of MedSpa services
- `hours` - Operating hours

Run with `python glowscape_agent.py` and ask something like *"Find medspas in Miami"* to trigger the tool.

_**User (2025-12-05 00:13Z)**_

Add to the execution the requirement that it explicitly communicates the tool that it used in answering the user's request if it used a tool

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants the agent to explicitly mention which tool it used when responding to requests. I need to update the instructions to make this clearer. Currently the instructions say "After calling the medspa_extraction_tool, ALWAYS inform the user that the tool call has been made and present the results." but I should make it more explicit that it should name the tool.

I'll update the GLOWSCAPE_INSTRUCTIONS to make this requirement clearer.</details></think>

Also let's organize the code such that the tools are in a folder.

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to organize the code by moving the tools into a separate folder. This is a good refactoring practice. I should:

1. Create a `tools` folder
2. Create a `__init__.py` in the tools folder
3. Create a `medspa_tools.py` file that contains the medspa extraction tool and related functions/data
4. Update the main `glowscape_agent.py` to import from the tools module

+ # GlowScape Agent
+ 
+ A conversational AI agent specialized in extracting and analyzing MedSpa business information from Google Maps/Places.
+ 
+ ## Features
+ 
+ - Interactive terminal-based chat interface
+ - MedSpa location extraction by city
+ - Structured business data (name, address, phone, ratings, reviews, services, hours)
+ - Powered by Agno framework with OpenAI models
+ - Google Maps/Places data via Apify (integration in progress)
+ 
+ ## Project Structure
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ GlowScape/
+ ├── glowscape_agent.py      # Main agent application
+ ├── tools/                  # Custom tools directory
+ │   ├── __init__.py        # Tools module initialization
+ │   └── medspa_tools.py    # MedSpa extraction tools
+ ├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
+ ├── .env.local             # Environment variables (create this)
+ └── README.md              # This file
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Setup
+ 
+ 1. **Install dependencies:**
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+    pip install -r requirements.txt
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ 2. **Create &#96;.env.local&#96; file:**
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;
+    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
+    APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_apify_api_token_here
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ 3. **Run the agent:**
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+    python glowscape_agent.py
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Usage
+ 
+ Once running, you can interact with GlowScape:
+ 
+ - **Get capabilities:** "What can you help me with?"
+ - **Extract MedSpas:** "Find medspas in Miami"
+ - **Exit:** Type &#96;quit&#96;, &#96;exit&#96;, or &#96;q&#96;
+ 
+ ## Current Status
+ 
+ - ✅ Basic agent with system prompt
+ - ✅ Tool calling infrastructure
+ - ✅ Mock MedSpa data generation
+ - 🔄 Apify integration (coming soon)
+ 
+ ## Tools
+ 
+ ### &#96;medspa_extraction_tool&#96;
+ Extracts MedSpa locations from a specified city.
+ 
+ **Parameters:**
+ - &#96;city&#96; (str): The city or geographic area to search
+ 
+ **Returns:**
+ - JSON with MedSpa business details (currently mock data)
+ 
+ ## Development Notes
+ 
+ The agent explicitly communicates which tools it uses when answering requests, providing transparency in its operations.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Perfect! The code has been reorganized. Let me summarize what was done.</details></think>

Done. The code has been reorganized into a cleaner structure:

**New Project Structure:**
```
GlowScape/
├── glowscape_agent.py      # Main agent (94 lines, down from 167)
├── tools/                  # Tools directory
│   ├── __init__.py         # Exports medspa_extraction_tool
│   └── medspa_tools.py     # MedSpa extraction logic (104 lines)
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md               # Project documentation
└── .env.local             # Environment config
```

**Changes Made:**

1. **Created `tools/` directory** with organized tool modules
2. **Moved tool code** - All MedSpa extraction logic (mock data, helper functions, tool decorator) to `tools/medspa_tools.py`
3. **Simplified main file** - `glowscape_agent.py` now just imports and uses tools: `from tools import medspa_extraction_tool`
4. **Added README.md** - Project documentation with setup instructions and structure overview

The agent functionality remains identical, but the codebase is now more maintainable and follows better separation of concerns.
